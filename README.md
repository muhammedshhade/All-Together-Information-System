# ATIS - System Information Together All

## 🧠 Project Overview
**ATIS (System Information Together All)** is a distributed Java-based emergency response system developed for the Ministry of Social Services. It enables users to request help or volunteer during emergency situations. The system is designed using a client-server architecture and operates over a local area network (LAN) in its first version.

## 🎯 Main Features
- 📢 **Distress Button**: Registered users can send distress signals in emergency situations (e.g., medical, safety threats).
- 🤝 **Help Requests**: Users can request assistance such as transportation, babysitting, or buying medicine.
- 👥 **Volunteering**: Other users may volunteer to complete tasks based on help requests.
- 📊 **Community Manager Tools**: Community managers can manage members, approve or reject help requests, view distress call statistics, and generate reports.

## 🗃️ Data Model Overview
- **User**: Name, ID, role (User/Manager), credentials, community affiliation.
- **Distress Call**: User, community, timestamp, optional location/code.
- **Task (Help Request)**: ID, type of help, requester, creation time, volunteer (if any), status (requested, pre-execution, executed), completion time.

## 🧩 System Architecture
- **Backend**: Java-based application server handling user sessions, distress calls, help tasks, and manager tools.
- **Frontend**: GUI for users and managers built for desktop use (not web-based in this version).
- **Database**: Relational database (SQL-based) storing all user data, tasks, and distress call records.
- **Communication**: TCP/IP over LAN (local network only).

## 🏗️ Design Goals
- 💡 User-friendly interface and clear role separation.
- 🔐 Secure user identification via login.
- ⚙️ Real-time task updates and synchronization across clients.
- 🔄 Flexible architecture designed for future transition to an internet-accessible version.

## 🧪 Key Functionalities Implemented
- Sending and logging distress calls with validation.
- Creating, approving, rejecting, and assigning help tasks.
- Viewing distress call history with and without histograms.
- Dynamic updates in real-time across all open sessions.
- Visual distinction between user types using color-coded UIs.

## 👥 Collaboration Summary
Our team began by dividing the project into server-side and client-side components. After facing integration issues, we reorganized by feature: user functions, distress calls, help requests, manager views. We ensured real-time dynamic functionality and consistent UI/UX across components. Every team member contributed to all parts, with shared responsibilities and clear communication.

## 🔧 Challenges & Solutions
We encountered issues in synchronizing client-server communication, especially around real-time events and multi-threaded access. By designing a robust request-handling protocol and using mock user sessions for testing, we overcame these hurdles and ensured stable functionality.

## 📷 UI Highlights
- Color-coded interfaces: Red for distress, Blue for users, Purple for managers.
- Multiple simultaneous user logins supported.
- Real-time data updates across open sessions.

## 📁 Future Work
In the next phase, ATIS will be upgraded to support internet access and a web-based interface, using the flexible architecture already designed.
